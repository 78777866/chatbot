# **App Name**: CyberChat AI

## Core Features:

- Futuristic UI: Implement a React-based UI with Tailwind CSS, neon gradients, glassmorphism, and Framer Motion animations.
- API Integration: Enable custom API integration with OpenRouter, allowing users to set API keys, model selections, and provider preferences. The application acts as a tool so that a language model decides which endpoints, keys, and parameters to use when connecting with the user.
- File Upload: Allow users to upload .txt, .jpg, .png, and .pdf files (up to 10MB) with subsequent processing including text extraction and integration into chat.
- Chat Features: Provide core chat functionalities such as message bubbles, Markdown support, inline buttons, and local storage of chat history with search.
- Voice Interaction: Integrate Web Speech API for speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities, including microphone/speaker toggle and multi-language support.
- Web Search: Enables searching from the internet and displaying the content

## Style Guidelines:

- Neon color palette with a cyberpunk aesthetic, incorporating vibrant gradients and glowing effects.
- Dark and light theme options including a 'Cyberpunk' theme and a 'Minimal' theme.
- Accent color: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF) for highlights and interactive elements to enhance the futuristic feel.
- Use a clear and modern font to maintain readability against the visually busy neon backgrounds.
- Icons should be simple, geometric, and filled with a neon-like stroke. If they represent some element of computation or logic, consider having an angle bracket, greater-than symbol or slash in the icon.
- The chat window occupies 70% of the screen with a collapsible sidebar taking up the remaining 30%.
- Use subtle animations with Framer Motion for interactive elements and transitions to enhance the futuristic user experience.
